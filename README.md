# NoteLib
Adds notebooks to your server, which have a lot of functions, from changing the name to adding people to editors. Plugin was developed by me in 2020, after slightly improved in 2021. This plugin will work **exclusively in** [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix) **gamemode 
from** [NebulousCloud](https://github.com/NebulousCloud).

The plugin was developed by **AsterionProject**. Discord of our project: [discord.gg/Cz3EQJ7WrF](https://discord.gg/Cz3EQJ7WrF)

If you want to slightly change the plugin configuration, then you need to open the **sh_plugin.lua** file
```lua
PLUGIN.maxeditors = 30 -- How many notepad editors can there be
PLUGIN.maxpages = 15 -- How many pages editor can create
PLUGIN.maxchar_title = 32 -- Maximum character size for Title
PLUGIN.maxchar_text = 20000 -- Maximum character size for Text
```
